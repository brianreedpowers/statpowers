Time Between Gondola Cars at Sterling Winery
Description
These times represent times between gondolas at Sterling Winery. The main take-away: there are 7 cars, as evidenced by the somewhat regular increases in splits between every 7 cars. The reason the times are slightly non-constant is that the gondolas come off the tracks, so times will change a little between each period.

Usage
winery_cars
Format
A data frame with 52 observations on the following 2 variables.

obs_number
The observation number, e.g. observation 3 was immediately preceded by observation 2.

time_until_next
Time until this gondola car arrived since the last car had left.

Details
Important context: there was a sufficient line that people were leaving the winery.

So why is this data valuable? It indicates that the winery should add one more car since it has a lot of time wasted every 7th car. By adding another car, fewer visitors are likely to be turned away, resulting in increased revenue.
