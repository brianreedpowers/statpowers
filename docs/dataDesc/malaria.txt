Malaria Vaccine Trial
Description
Volunteer patients were randomized into one of two experiment groups where they would receive an experimental vaccine or a placebo. They were subsequently exposed to a drug-sensitive strain of malaria and observed to see whether they came down with an infection.

Usage
malaria
Format
A data frame with 20 observations on the following 2 variables.

treatment
Whether a person was given the experimental vaccine or a placebo.

outcome
Whether the person got an infection or no infection.

Details
In this study, volunteer patients were randomized into one of two experiment groups: 14 patients received an experimental vaccine or 6 patients received a placebo vaccine. Nineteen weeks later, all 20 patients were exposed to a drug-sensitive malaria virus strain; the motivation of using a drug-sensitive strain of virus here is for ethical considerations, allowing any infections to be treated effectively.
