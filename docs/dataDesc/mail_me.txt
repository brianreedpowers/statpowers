Influence of a Good Mood on Helpfulness
Description
This study investigated whether finding a coin influenced a person's likelihood of mailing a sealed but addressed letter that appeared to have been accidentally left in a conspicuous place. Several variables were collected during the experiment, including two randomized variables of whether there was a coin to be found and whether the letter already had a stamp on it.

Details
The precise context was in a phone booth (this study is from the 1970s!), where a person who entered a phone booth would find a dime in the phone tray, which would be sufficient to pay for their phone call. There was also a letter next to the phone, which sometimes had a stamp on it.
