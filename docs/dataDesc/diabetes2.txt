Type 2 Diabetes Clinical Trial for Patients 10-17 Years Old
Description
Three treatments were compared to test their relative efficacy (effectiveness) in treating Type 2 Diabetes in patients aged 10-17 who were being treated with metformin. The primary outcome was lack of glycemic control (or not); lacking glycemic control means the patient still needed insulin, which is not the preferred outcome for a patient.
