Embryonic stem cells to treat heart attack (in sheep)
Description
Does treatment using embryonic stem cells (ESCs) help improve heart function following a heart attack? Each sheep in the study was randomly assigned to the ESC or control group, and the change in their hearts' pumping capacity was measured in the study. A positive value corresponds to increased pumping capacity, which generally suggests a stronger recovery.
