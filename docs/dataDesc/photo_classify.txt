Photo classifications: fashion or not
Description
This is a simulated data set for photo classifications based on a machine learning algorithm versus what the true classification is for those photos. While the data are not real, they resemble performance that would be reasonable to expect in a well-built classifier.

Usage
photo_classify
Format
A data frame with 1822 observations on the following 2 variables.

mach_learn
The prediction by the machine learning system as to whether the photo is about fashion or not.

truth
The actual classification of the photo by a team of humans.

Details
The hypothetical ML algorithm has a precision of 90\ photos it claims are fashion, about 90\ The recall of the ML algorithm is about 64\ about fashion, it correctly predicts that they are about fashion about 64\ of the time.

Source
The data are simulated / hypothetical.
