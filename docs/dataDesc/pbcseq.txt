Mayo Clinic Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, sequential data
Description
This data is a continuation of the PBC data set, and contains the follow-up laboratory data for each study patient. An analysis based on the data can be found in Murtagh, et. al.

The primary PBC data set contains only baseline measurements of the laboratory parameters. This data set contains multiple laboratory results, but only on the 312 randomized patients. Some baseline data values in this file differ from the original PBC file, for instance, the data errors in prothrombin time and age which were discovered after the original analysis (see Fleming and Harrington, figure 4.6.7).

One "feature" of the data deserves special comment. The last observation before death or liver transplant often has many more missing covariates than other data rows. The original clinical protocol for these patients specified visits at 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. At these protocol visits lab values were obtained for a large pre-specified battery of tests. "Extra" visits, often undertaken because of worsening medical condition, did not necessarily have all this lab work. The missing values are thus potentially informative.
