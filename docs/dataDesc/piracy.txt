Details
The Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect Intellectual Property Act (PIPA) were two bills introduced in the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, respectively, to curtail copyright infringement. The bill was controversial because there were concerns the bill limited free speech rights. ProPublica, the independent and non-profit news organization, compiled this data set to compare the stance of legislators towards the bills with the amount of campaign funds that they received from groups considered to be supportive of or in opposition to the legislation.
