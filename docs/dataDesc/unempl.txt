Data prior to 1948 are for persons age 14 and over. Data beginning in 1948 are for persons age 16 and over. See also "Historical Comparability" under the Household Data section of the Explanatory Notes at https://www.bls.gov/cps/eetech_methods.pdf. 1890-1930 data are from Christina Romer (1986). "Spurious Volatility in Historical Unemployment Data", The Journal of Political Economy, 94(1): 1-37. 1930-1940 data are from Robert M. Coen (1973). "Labor Force and Unemployment in the 1920's and 1930's: A Re-Examination Based on Postwar Experience", The Review of Economics and Statistics, 55(1): 46-55. Unemployment data was only surveyed once each decade until 1940 when yearly surveys were begun. The yearly data estimates before 1940 are based on the decade surveys combined with other relevant surveys that were collected during those years. The methods are described in detail by Coen and Romer.
