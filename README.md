StatPowers is an open source web-based statistical software suite developed by Brian Powers. I've finally gotten around to hosting the code on github.

It's written in HTML and JavaScript with just a little bit of PHP for a couple of pieces of functionality. The site is hosted at [StatPowers.com](https://www.statpowers.com), but on May 8, 2025 I set up a github page to mirror most of the functionality in case the web host ever goes down.

The intention has always been to provide a super intuitive, easy to play with platform for working with data, probability, simulation, visualizations, estimation and hypothesis testing. The intented audience is a typical first course in statistics at the college level.
